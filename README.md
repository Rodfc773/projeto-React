## Introduction

The app doesn't yet have a name, but its aim is basically to function as front-end of a website for a fictitious school.

The application allows users and students to be created, profiles to be updated, including uploading files such as photos and searching for a specific student.

The aim of this project is purely educational, so this user can learn about the React framework.


The REST API that this front-end project consumes has also been built for this user's learning purposes, and will be made available in the future, and like this application, will also be documented.

At this date (24/06/2024) the front-end side is not concluded yet
